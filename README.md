discrete event simulator for operating systems class

//ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OR TO WHOM ELSE THIS MAY CONCERN,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//This is proof of concept that you can run in the terminal to see the simulator
//The almost identical versions where over 1000 processes can be generated to csv will be
//under cpu_FileCreator
//I saved this one and made it easy for you because until I get better at braching this is the best I can do
// if you clone the branch backup that should run the file creator
// under (RR|SJF||FCFS||SJFPremptive|)_FileCreator.java
// the ability to see the code and run either this branch which is main or the _FileCreator versions is hopefully ok
// the _FileCreator branch became so big I would have to sign up to special github for large files in order to push it
// to the repository, hopefully this will work
// if you want to access to read over them
// A COPY OF THE _FileCreator JAVA FILES ARE UNDER cpu_FileCreator
// I think if you want to build and run them they will eventually be runnable under a branch whenever I can figure out aa way around the size limit
// this verison will do everything in the terminal, I think even better then the one for the files I designed, but it is definitely slower.
// Even though you/re done grading this I am going to make it more user friendly
