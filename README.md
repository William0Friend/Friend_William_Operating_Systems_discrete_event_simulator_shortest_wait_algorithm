NEVERMIND I FIXED RR in both programs

//This is proof of concept that you can run in the terminal to see the simulator
//The almost identical versions where over 1000 processes can be generated to csv will be
//under cpu_FileCreator
//I saved this one and made it easy for you because until I get better at braching this is the best I can do
// if you clone the branch backup that should run the file creator
// under (RR|SJF||FCFS||SJFPremptive|)_FileCreator.java
// the ability to see the code and run either this branch which is main or the _FileCreator versions is hopefully ok
// the _FileCreator branch became so big I would have to sign up to special github for large files in order to push it
// to the repository, hopefully this will work
// if you want to access to read over them
// A COPY OF THE _FileCreator JAVA FILES ARE UNDER cpu_FileCreator
// I think if you want to build and run them they will eventually be runnable under a branch whenever I can figure out aa way around the size limit
// this verison will do everything in the terminal, I think even better then the one for the files I designed, but it is definitely slower.
// Even though you/re done grading this I am going to make it more user friendly

Sorry if two versions causes confusion but the file output isn't as good as the termianl output

WHEN RUNNING THE PROGRAMS READ BELOW
Both have same terminal prompt for process amount
Just enter any integer value
A couple thousand should be fine


For Building the projects
you can go to ideaJ or similar ide
select the IdeaProjects/des/  --> for terminal output
select the IdeaProjects/des_FileCreator --> for csv output
Under IdeaProjects/
      des/  --> this one does any random process amount in the terminal, I think it is better though
      des_FileCreator --> this one is the version that outputs to csv which i thought was nessisary earlier. Now I see how I can fix it all.
      
   //from the excel charts I created   
   rr4.csv  --> RR ouput     -->
   sjf.csv  --> SJF output   --> These are all on first github page, I didn't want new ones to be made if you ran the des_FileCreator
   sjfp.csv --> SJFP output  -->        if you do run it these will not change only the local one
   fcfs.csv --> FCFS output  -->
   
   
   Have a great Summer professer see you next semester.
